		<h2>COMP330: Computer Graphics (2017s1)</h2>
		<h3>Assignment 3</h3>
		<p>Prepared by Scott McCallum
                <br>Questions to: scott.mccallum@mq.edu.au</p>
		<p><b>Due Date:</b> 11:55pm, Monday 5 June 2017.</p>
		<p>This assignment is designed to give you practice 
with fundamental aspects of 3D graphics programming including:
			</p><ol type="A">
				<li>Hierarchical 3D modelling.</li>
				<li>User activated animations.</li>
				<li>Perspective viewing from both a fixed and
                                    moving viewpoint in 3D space.</li>
				<li>Viewports.</li>
				<li>Use of lighting and texturing.</li>
				<li>Scene management, generation.</li>
			</ol>
		<p></p>

<p>The objective of the assignment is to design and implement in C++ and OpenGL
a program which displays a simple aircraft flight animation. A program like this is
also known as a flight simulator.
The aircraft should initially be located at the airport terminal ready for departure.
Then it should taxi to the runway, take off, ascend to the desired altitude
(turning as appropriate), execute some flight acrobatics (as appropriate), land,
and taxi back to the terminal. Four viewports, each providing
a different view of your scene as spelled out in the detailed requirements
below, are requested to be displayed.
The following picture is a screenshot from Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0,
which shows a Cessna Skylane flying over Chicago.

<p>You may like to look up the Wikipedia article on the history
of the Microsoft Flight Simulator series.
Subsequent versions of this popular program provided more detailed scenery
and more realistic aircraft. However, you should probably aim to provide
relatively simple graphics, as illustrated by FS 3.0 above, or perhaps a bit more
realistic than that. The main goal is to practise the fundamental techniques of 3D
graphics listed above.</p>

<p>You are free to design your own aircraft and scenery, within the
general requirements detailed below.</p>

<p>Your program will be marked out of 40, and
this mark will be worth 20% of your final mark
for this unit. </p>

		<h3>Relevant sample programs</h3>
<p>Two relevant sample programs are available for downloading from the
Assignments section of the COMP330 iLearn space:
<code>robotArmLambert.zip</code> and
<code>manualModelling.zip</code> 
(These files are also available in the Week 8 section.)
Study, compile (build), and run each program.</p>

<p>Notice that the scene displayed by the first program can be simply
animated via the keyboard bottom row zxcvbnm, (together with pqr), 
or alternatively by pressing 1
to obtain a timed animation. This program <b>does not</b> use a scene graph
to store a logical model of the scene.
Consequently its structure is relatively simple: no classes are defined, but
there are numerous functions.</p>

<p>The scene displayed by the second program shows a simple timed animation
of a "quad chain"; some other objects are displayed fixed.
This program <b>does</b> use a scene graph (tree) 
to store a logical model of the scene.
Furthermore, this program makes strong use of object oriented programming techniques
to represent and process the scene graph (tree).
Consequently, it structure is relatively complex: a class is defined for each scene
object, and some such classes are derived from others.
Nevertheless, the overall structure of the program is not too difficult to understand.
It will be discussed in practical classes.</p>

<p>You are free to use <b>either</b> (or neither, or both) of these sample programs
to guide your work on this assignment. Indeed you could use one of the sample programs,
of your choice and modified as necessary, as a kind of starting point for your work. 
But since your assigned requirements are very different 
from the features of the sample programs,
you may want to prune much away from your chosen sample program before starting your
own development work.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind also that lectures and practical classes 
will provide you with many of the concepts you will need to be successful 
in this assignment and in the final exam.</p>

		<h3>Tasks</h3>
The requirements are set out below in more detail.<p></p>

<ol>
<li>(4 marks) <b>Title page</b>
<p>
Please provide a simple but attractive title page in colour which introduces
the user to the program. (This page should contain at least your name and an
image of your aircraft.)</p>
</li>

<li>(12 marks) <b>The initial scene</b>
<p>
Upon the user's request four viewports should appear on the screen.
The main (largest) viewport, which spans the length of the screen
window, should contain a "third person" 
perspective view of an aircraft parked at the terminal.
Your aircraft should be propeller driven.
A runway and some other buildings should also be in the scene.
If you wish, regard this third person view as from the airport control tower.
The three smaller viewports, all located below the main one, should each contain
a different view of the scene. The left one of these
should contain a perspective side view of
the aircraft from a close up camera <b>which moves with the aircraft</b>.
The middle one of these should contain a perspective view of the scene from the cockpit
(a "first person" view). The cockpit view should include a simple
instrument panel including such instruments as
speedometer, altimeter, compass and fuel gauge.
The instrument panel should be part of the aircraft, that is, part of your
3D scene, rather than a separate 2D "overlay" as appears to be used in the FS 3.0
screenshot above.
The right smaller viewport should contain a simple radar
view (that is, a "top down" or "plan" view from above) of the scene.
</p>

<p>
Please provide to the user a means by which he or she could <b>cycle through</b>
the positions on the screen of the four viewports.
That is, the user should have the possibility to select <b>any</b>
of the four viewports as the main one.
You could assign the tab key, say, to control viewport cycling.
</p>

<p>You should also provide some basic lighting for your scene. For example, define
a single light source (the sun, say), and 
assign appropriate properties to it and the materials.
</p></li>

<li>(12 marks) <b>User initiated animations</b>
<p>
Upon pressing a certain key (1, say), the aircraft should back away from
the terminal then taxi a short distance to the end of the runway.
After pausing there for a moment, it should take off, climb to the desired
altitude, turning as needed, then execute a holding pattern (flying in a circle
at the same altitude).
Upon pressing another key (2, say), the aircraft should execute
some flight acrobatic manoeuvre such as "corkscrew" (rotating about
longitudinal axis), then return to holding pattern. 
Upon pressing another key (3, say), it should
execute some other manoeuvre such as "looping", then return to
holding pattern. Finally, upon pressing
still another key (4, say), it should prepare for landing,
return to the airport, then taxi back to the terminal.
</p>
</li>

<li>(6 marks) <b>Further features</b> 
<p>
Time permitting, you could provide further features such as:
</p><ul>
<li> use of textures
</li><li> a more detailed or more realistic aircraft
</li><li> a more realistic airport and surroundings
</li><li> more realistic instruments whose readings reflect the current state
     of the flight
</li><li> use of an advanced instrument such as a gyroscopic indicator
</li><li> use of special effects (such as rain)
</li></ul>
As a rough guide, each of the above will earn you approximately 2 marks,
up to a maximum of 6 marks for this component.
<p></p> 
</li>

<li>(4 marks) <b>Coding style</b> 
<p>
Four marks will be awarded for good coding style, including such aspects as
modularity, understandability and reusability.</p>
</li>

<li>(2 marks) <b>Documentation</b> 
<p>
Two marks will be awarded for good documentation. This does not
have to be extensive; but please inform the user (marker) about the keyboard
commands, mouse actions, etc. that are available, unless they are
clear to a user simply by looking at the screen upon starting up.
Documentation could be supplied as part of your electronic submission.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
		
		<h3>Extra Functionality</h3>
		<p>There will be some of you that will find this 
selection of scene components and aircraft movements to be insufficiently
challenging. You are free to add more of this as you wish. 
We cannot give you extra marks, but you won't be marked down either.
		</p>
		<h3>Submission</h3>
		<p>Please submit an exported eclipse project 
                in a .zip file to iLearn by the due date.
                Do not include your executable program.
                Your documentation can be included in your project folder.</p>
		<p>Please format the .zip file as "COMP330_A3_[your student number].zip".</p>
		<h3>Questions / Comments</h3>
		<p>Please direct any questions or comments to 
scott.mccallum@mq.edu.au or post in the Assignment 3 forum on iLearn.
