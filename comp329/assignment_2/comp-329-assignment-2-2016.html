 <title>COMP329 Assignment 2: iKnow - A Tutoring System for COMP329</title>

<h1>COMP329 Assignment 2</h1>
<hr width="100%">

<p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>In this assignment you will implement iKnow329, a prototype of an intelligent tutoring system,
   in <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI Prolog</a> (version 7.2.3). iKnow329 should ask a
   student questions about three predefined topics taught in COMP329 (Knowledge Systems), evaluate the
   student's answer to a question, give hints if a student has difficulty to answer
   a certain type of questions, inform the student about the outcome of a run during a session, and
   store the results at the end of a session for subsequent inspection by a teacher. That means the system should
   provide two modes: a student mode where the student interacts with the tutoring
   system and a teacher mode where the teacher can review the results of a student.</p>

<p>First you will implement a basic version of iKnow329 that you can then take as
   a starting point for the full version that provides broader coverage and additional features.</p>

<h3>2. Basic Version of iKnow329</h3>

<p>Below is an example of a run where a student interacts with the basic version of iKnow329 in
   student mode. Note that in this (idealised) example the student answers all questions correctly and 
   therefore iKnow329 does not display any hints.</p>

<pre>
====================================================
Welcome to iKnow329 - an Intelligent Tutoring System
====================================================

Enter your ID:
|: s1

Choose one of the following difficulty levels: easy, medium, or hard.
|: easy

Choose one of the following topics: parsing, probability theory, Prolog.
|: Prolog

1: What does Prolog stand for?
|: programming in logic

Your answer is correct.

2: Is Prolog a procedural programming language?
|: no

Your answer is correct.

3: Does the following unification succeed: [a, [b]|[c, d]]=[X, Y, Z]?
|: yep

Your answer is correct.

4: What is the most common data structure in Prolog?
|: lists

Your answer is correct.

5: Why is Prolog good for AI programming?
|: Because Prolog is good at pattern-matching.

Your answer is correct.

Congratulations: you got 5 marks.

Another run? yes/no 
|: yes

...

</pre>

<p>As you can see, after the start (<i>?- start.</i>) the student has to provide the student ID for a session. 
   For each run during a session, the tutoring system asks the student to select a level of difficulty (easy, medium,
   or hard) and to choose a topic (in our case: parsing or probability theory or Prolog). The 
   tutoring system then asks the student exactly 5 questions. Some of these questions have 
   the form of yes/no-questions and some have the form of wh-questions. The answer to a yes/no-question
   is always <strong>yes</strong> or <strong>no</strong> (or one of its variations). The answer to a wh-question 
   (what, why, where, how, ...) can be one or more words or even an entire sentence. As you would expect, 
   wh-questions are more challenging to process since you have to do some advanced pattern matching.
    A run ends with a laudatio where the system informs the student
   about the result of the run and asks if the student wants to continue or not. </p>

<p>Of course, things do not go always so smoothly and a student might fail to answer
   a question (see question 2 and 4 below). In the case of a wh-question, the tutoring 
   system should offer a hint, if the student provides the wrong answer (as illustrated below for question 4). 
   However, if the student asks for a hint and subsequently answers the question correctly,
   then the student will not get full marks for that question (in our case half a mark will be deduced for an easy question).
   On the other hand, if the answer to a wh-question was wrong and the student does not accept a hint, 
   then you give 0 marks for that question and move on to the next question (if there is still one left).</p>

Thanks for using iKnow329.

</pre>


<p>The basic version of iKnow329 should also provide a teacher mode where
   a teacher can login to the system and inspect the results of a student.</p>

<p>For example for student 's1', teacher 't1' should be able to login and see the following 
   results after the two runs completed above.</p>

<pre>
2 ?- start.

Thanks for using iKnow329.

</pre>

<p>In order to implement the basic version of this tutoring system, you <strong>only</strong> have 
   to implement the difficulty level 'easy' and the topic 'Prolog' (but your system has to display
   a warning if the student selects a different difficulty level and/or topic that has not been
   implemented for the basic version of the system).</p>

<p>You have to use the file (<i>kterms.pl</i>) for the basic version of this assignment
  that comes with the starter
  kit (<a href="http://ilearn.mq.edu.au/pluginfile.php/4221887/mod_folder/content/0/assignment-2-starter-kit.zip?forcedownload=1">assignment-2-starter-kit.zip</a>). 
   This start starter kit consists of three files: <i>iKnow329.pl</i>, <i>kterms.pl</i>, and <i>users.pl</i>.

   The files <i>kterms.pl</i> and <i>users.pl</i> are loaded automatically at the start of the system (<i>iKnow329.pl</i>). The 
   initial file <i>kterms.pl</i> consists of exactly those five knowledge terms (<i>kterm/6</i>) that
   have been used in the "easy Prolog" session above. These 
   knowledge terms have 6 arguments: number, topic, level, question, answer, and hint; each one 
   represented as a term. The term <i>question/3</i> has three arguments: question type, actual question, 
   mark for the question. The term <i>answer/2</i> has two arguments: the correct answer and a list of 
   acceptable answers that can be tested against the input of the student. The term <i>hint/2</i> has two 
   arguments: one for the hint to be displayed and one for the value to be deduced from the 
   student's marks if the hint has been used. As already explained, it only makes sense to use a hint in 
   the context of a wh-question.</p>

<pre>
% -----------------------------------------------------------
% kterm/6
% -----------------------------------------------------------

kterm(number(1), 
      topic(prolog), 
      level(easy), 
      question(wh, 'What does Prolog stand for?', 1), 
      answer('Programming in Logic', [[programming, in, logic], [logic, programming]]), 
      hint('Pro... in Log...', 0.5)).

kterm(number(2), 
      topic(prolog), 
      level(easy), 
      question(yn, 'Is Prolog a procedural programming language?', 1), 
      answer('no', [[no], [nope], [nah]]), 
      hint(nil, nil)).

kterm(number(3), 
      topic(prolog), 
      level(easy), 
      question(yn, 'Does the following unification succeed: [a, [b]|[c, d]]=[X, Y, Z]?', 1), 
      answer('yes', [[yes], [yep], [sure]]),  
      hint(nil, nil)).

kterm(number(4), 
      topic(prolog), 
      level(easy), 
      question(wh, 'What is the most common data structure in Prolog?', 1), 
      answer('lists', [[list], [lists]]), 
      hint('It has a head and a tail.', 0.5)).

kterm(number(5), 
      topic(prolog), 
      level(easy), 
      question(wh, 'Why is Prolog good for AI programming?', 1), 
      answer('Because Prolog is good at pattern matching', [[pattern, matching], ['pattern-matching']]), 
      hint('Regular expressions provide a similar functionality.', 0.5)).

</pre>

<p>The file (<i>users.pl</i>) that is also automatically loaded at the start of the system 
   needs to be maintained during a session. This file contains only three student IDs (s1, s2, and s3)
   and one teacher ID (t1). We don't worry about more detailed user information and passwords for our
   prototype. However, we worry about the students' history and achievements during the tutoring sessions.
   At the beginning, the file <i>users.pl</i> adds the following information to the knowledge base: </p>

<pre>
student(s1,[]).
student(s2,[]).
student(s3,[]).

teacher(t1).

</pre>

consisting of two types of facts: <i>student/2</i> and <i>teacher/1</i>. The information in <i>users.pl</i> is
loaded at the start of a session into the knowledge base, updated in the knowledge base after each run
and then written to the file <i>users.pl</i> at the end of a session. The second argument of <i>student/2</i> is used
to store a student's history and achievements. In our case, the file <i>users.pl</i> looks as follows at the end of
our session:

<pre>

student(s1,[[prolog, easy, 3.5], [prolog, easy, 5]]).
student(s2,[]).
student(s3,[]).

teacher(t1).

</pre>

<p>Note that the user ID starts either with an "s" for student or a "t" for teacher, the tutoring system should 
branch either into the student mode or the teacher mode according to the provided input, and prompt the user again if
the user provides a wrong input.</p>

<p>The top predicate <i>start/0</i> of <i>iKnow329.pl</i> shows the two files (<i>kterms.pl</i> and <i>users.pl</i>) 
  that are loaded for each session, the two  modes that the system has to support and the file (<i>users.pl</i>) that
  needs to be updated after each session.</p>

</pre>

<p>The implementation of the basic version of iKnow329 is worth 12 marks. Please check the marking schema below
   for the distribution of these marks.</p>


<h3>3. Full Version of iKnow329</h3>

<p>In order to implement the full version of the tutoring system, you have to provide additional data for three topics and three
   difficulty levels. You already have data for one topic (Prolog) and one difficulty level (easy) as 5 knowledge terms are 
   already in <i>kterms.pl</i>. In order to complete the implementation, you have to add 40 additional knowledge terms that encode
   different pieces of knowledge. Prolog is one topic that the tutoring system has to support, the other two topics
   are <strong>parsing</strong> and <strong>probability theory</strong>. At least 20 of these 40 knowledge terms should contain wh-questions. You have 
   to use the following marking schema to process the hints of wh-questions 
   for these different difficulty levels (remember the cost for a hint of an easy question is 0.5 mark):</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 1 mark for an easy question answered correctly but only 0.5 mark if the students used the hint;</li>
    <li> 2 marks for a medium question answered correctly but only 1 mark if the student used the hint;</li>
    <li> 3 marks for a hard question answered correctly but only 1.5 mark if the sutdent used the hint.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This extension is worth 5 marks.</p>
  <p> You can get an additional 3 marks for this assignment for the implementation of a 
     specific feature that you think is useful and
     adds value to the tutoring system. For example, a mechanism that tries to correct the user input automatically 
     in case of misspelling might be very helpful or more detailed information about a student's history and achievements
     (the current information is indeed very rudimentary). If you choose to add such an additional feature to the tutoring system, 
     you will need to document this feature in a two-page report and explain why this feature adds value to your system.</p>


<h3>4. Assessment </h3>

<p> This assigment is worth 20 marks (= 20% of the final marks for COMP329). 
    The basic version of the assingment is worth 12 marks and the full version is
    worth an additional 8 marks. You will be awarded marks according to the following 
    guidelines:</p>
