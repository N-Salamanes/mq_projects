NOTES
Correct output on supplied test cases: 0.8 marks.
The output and error output of your program is compared with expected
output. Any significant differences count as a failed test.  The mark
is reduced by 0.1 for each error, up to a maximum of 8 errors when the
mark becomes 0.0.

Correct output on hidden test cases: 1.0 marks.
The output and error output of your program is compared with expected
output. Any significant differences count as a failed test.  The mark
is reduced by 0.1 for each error, up to a maximum of 10 errors when
the mark becomes 0.0.

Use stat system call: 0.2 marks.
File modification times should be obtained using a member of the stat
family of system calls.  This is a pass/fail marking item.  Either you
are awarded the maximum mark of 0.2 for satisfying the item, or you
are awarded 0.0.

Total mark is out of 2.0.
