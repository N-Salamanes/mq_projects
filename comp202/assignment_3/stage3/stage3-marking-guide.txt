NOTES
Correct output on supplied test cases: 0.8 marks.
The output and error output of your program is compared with expected
output. Any significant differences count as a failed test.  The mark
is reduced by 0.1 for each error, up to a maximum of 8 errors when the
mark becomes 0.0.

Correct output on hidden test cases: 0.8 marks.
The output and error output of your program is compared with expected
output. Any significant differences count as a failed test.  The mark
is reduced by 0.1 for each error, up to a maximum of 8 errors when the
mark becomes 0.0.

Use fork system call: 0.1 marks.
Executing a command requires fork to create a new process.  This is a
pass/fail marking item.  Either you are awarded the maximum mark of
0.1 for satisfying the item, or you are awarded 0.0.

Use exec system call: 0.1 marks.
Executing a command require a member of the exec family of system
calls.  This is a pass/fail marking item.  Either you are awarded the
maximum mark of 0.1 for satisfying the item, or you are awarded 0.0.

Use /dev/null: 0.1 marks.
Suppress standard output or standard error by redirecting to
/dev/null.  This is a pass/fail marking item.  Either you are awarded
the maximum mark of 0.1 for satisfying the item, or you are awarded
0.0.

Use wait system call: 0.1 marks.
Get command exit status using a member of the wait family of system
calls.  This is a pass/fail marking item.  Either you are awarded the
maximum mark of 0.1 for satisfying the item, or you are awarded 0.0.

Total mark is out of 2.0.
