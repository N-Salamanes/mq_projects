NOTES
Program compiles correctly: threshold.
The program must compile correctly in order to be awarded other marks
that require the thresholds.

Program executes successfully: threshold.
The program must execute to completion on all test cases in order to
be awarded other marks that require the thresholds.

Correct struct definition: threshold.
The struct definition must have correct field names and types in order
to be awarded other marks that require the thresholds.

Use memory allocation (malloc etc.): threshold.
The program must dynamically allocate memory using malloc in order to
be awarded other marks that require the thresholds.

Exit without error in normal usage: threshold.
See "Systems Programming Style".  The program must exit with
appropriate status in order to be awarded other marks that require the
thresholds.

Correct output on supplied test files: 1.0 marks.
An average mark representing the portion of correct output columns for
the test files provided to the student.  The mark will be suppressed
(set to zero) if any threshold requirement is not met.

Correct output on hidden test file: 0.7 marks.
An average mark representing the portion of correct output columns for
the additional test files not provided to the student.  The mark will
be suppressed (set to zero) if any threshold requirement is not met.

No memory leak: 0.1 marks.
See "Systems Programming Style".  The program should not have memory
leaks, otherwise the mark will be 0.0.  The mark will be suppressed
(set to zero) if any threshold requirement is not met.

Adaptive memory allocation: 0.1 marks.
The program should adapt its use of memory allocation, using less
memory for small files, otherwise the mark will be 0.0.  The mark will
be suppressed (set to zero) if any threshold requirement is not met.

Files are opened and closed: 0.1 marks.
See "Systems Programming Style".  The program should close every file
that it opens, otherwise the mark will be 0.0.  The mark will be
suppressed (set to zero) if any threshold requirement is not met.

Total mark is out of 2.0.
