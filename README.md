### ISYS358 - Computing Industry Project
This unit draws together learning in previous units to prepare students for the workplace. Students work in teams to develop a project plan which is used to manage gathering, modelling and specification of requirements, and develop an appropriate design to solve a given problem, potentially delivering a substantial software product. All projects will involve the development of supporting project documentation appropriate to an information systems setting. The project requires an equal focus on process and the product, requiring the use of quality control and assurance methods, tools and techniques.

- Software product
  - I created a prototype of a timesheet application for Pacom Systems.
  - Languages used: C# and Razor

### COMP332 - Programming Languages
Formal languages play a central role in modern software development. Programming languages such as Java and C++ allow developers to express their algorithms and data structures. Compilers and interpreters transform programs into running software. Data languages such as XML and JSON are widely used to transfer information between systems. This unit studies software languages by looking at how they are used in software development. Students will study how to formally understand the syntax, semantics and translation of software languages. Practical exercises involve writing software language processors of various kinds such as simple compilers or data transformation tools.

- Assignment 1
  - The first assignment focuses on processing the syntax of a language to obtain a representation that the rest of the implementation can use.
  - Languages used: Scala

- Assignment 2
  - The second assignment focuses on the semantics of a language by processing the representation produced by syntax analysis to check language rules and provide information needed for later processing.
  - Languages used: Scala

- Assignment 3
  - The third assignment focuses on translating a language into some other form, such as another structured language (e.g., translating a programming language into a lower-level form such as bytecode or assembly language).
  - Languages used: Scala

## Session 1, 2017

### COMP343 - Cryptography and Information Security
This unit provides an introduction to modern cryptography and information security. First, some cryptographic primitives, such as private key and public key ciphers, hash functions and digital signatures, are introduced. Then, some security technologies are discussed to illustrate how basic cryptographic primitives are concretely used in real life applications. Various attacks on the cryptographic schemes and protocols are also discussed.

- Assignment 1
  - Assignment comprises two parts. The first part involves the implementation of a hash function. The second part deals with a public key cryptoprimitives.
  - Languages used: Gp

### COMP348 - Document Processing and the Semantic Web
This unit explores the issues involved in building natural language processing (NLP) applications that operate on large bodies of real text such as are found on the world wide web. With the web full of unstructured and largely text-based data, the applications needed to handle this have their own particular characteristics. In this unit we discuss some core applications for dealing with data on the web, such as spam filtering and search engines. The unit also explores some developments of web, such as emerging semantic web technologies which support the exchange of XML metadata on the web, and Web 2.0 technologies (such as social networking, folksonomies, wikis and blogs). Application areas covered include information retrieval, web search, document summarisation, machine translation and information extraction.

- Assignment 1
  - In this assignment you will implement a simple document processing application that uses pre-packaged tools.
  - Languages used: Python

- Assignment 2
  - This assignment will use more powerful techniques such as those used in commercial and research applications. You will experience the processing of real text data, which can be messy and unpredictable at times. At the end of the assignment you will submit a report describing the system, its implementation, and its evaluation.
  - Languages used: Python

- Assignment 3
  - In this assignment you will experiment with the integration of Semantic Web technology into document processing. You will be asked to study a particular domain and report on the integration of Semantic Web technnologies suitable for the domain, including what sort of SPARQL queries would be applicable to solve specific user needs.
  - Languages used: Python

### COMP330 - Computer Graphics
This unit is the study of pictures, images and animations generated by computers, as well as tools used to produce these pictures. This unit introduces the mathematical foundations of computer graphics, examines how to model three-dimensional objects, introduces techniques for creating animations, and explores how realistic scenes are rendered. Practical work involves using a graphics library, such as OpenGL, under Unix or Windows platforms.

- Assignment 1
  - You will develop an interactive 2D graphics application using OpenGL and C++. This application will provide an interactive experience for the user but will only involve 2D graphics.
  - Languages used: C++

- Assignment 3
  - You will create an interactive 3D graphics application using OpenGL and C++. Your program will display on the screen the 3D appearance of a scene.
  - Languages used: C++

## Session 2, 2016

### COMP202 - Systems Programming
This unit studies the boundary between software and the systems on which software executes. It considers the impact of constraints imposed by operating systems and hardware systems on the design and performance of computer software. Students will learn how to operate within these constraints to build effective systems software. The unit studies these issues by looking below the abstractions provided by high-level programming languages. The unit is an introduction to systems programming and related issues. It provides an entry point into more advanced study of computer systems in the following areas: hardware implementation, operating systems, network design and programming, and programming language design and implementation.

- Assignment 1
  - Data files exist in various formats.  In Unix, text files are common for simple data, but large data files are stored as binary data.  In this lab, you will be developing programs to read, write, modify,and reformat the data in binary data files.
  - Languages used: C

- Assignment 2
  - The nefarious Dr. Evilhas planted a slew of ``binary bombs'' onour servers. A binary bomb is a program that consists of asequence of phases. Each phase expects you to type a particular stringon stdin. If you type the correct string, then the phase isdefusedand the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise, thebomb explodesby printing “BOOM!!!”(or something similar) and thenterminating. The bomb isdefused when every phase has been defused.
   - Languages used: Assembly

- Assignment 3
  - In this lab assignment, you will develop an implementation of make with a difference.  Your make program will still have the basic functionality of make, but it will have some different capabilities that set it apart.
  - Languages used: C

### COMP329 - Knowledge Systems
This unit examines selected topics in artificial intelligence (AI) and expert systems. One of the main AI languages is Prolog, that involves programming in a declarative rather than in the usual procedural manner. Since Prolog is based upon first order logic, an introduction is given to various aspects of logic – this forms a good basis upon which to understand Prolog and how it works. The unit also covers topics in artificial intelligence.

- Assignment 1
  - The first assignment will require demonstrating your skill in (1) representing knowledge and reasoning in formal language(s), and  (2) programming in Prolog.
  - Languages used: Prolog

- Assignment 2
  - The second assignment will require you to work in problem solving, and submit your solution together with a written document (in the form of a pdf file) answering several  fundamental questions that test your understanding of the relevant material. The problem may involve logic programming, probabilistic reasoning, or both.
  - Languages used: Prolog
